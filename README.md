## 📌 Business / Health Questions Answered
### Excel Analysis

- How does workout type affect calories burned?

- Is higher workout intensity linked to higher BPM?

- Which diet types correlate with healthier BMI?

- How does water intake relate to workout performance?

### SQL Analysis

- Calories burned by workout type & experience level

- Average BMI and fat % by diet type
